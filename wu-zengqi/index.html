   <h2 id="a">前言：找到曾祖父</h2>
   
     <p>我第一次見到曾祖父吳曾祺，是兩年前網路上發現的一張照片。他兩頰瘦削，白鬚冉冉，眼神犀利篤定， 長袍馬褂瓜皮帽，是典型清朝文人的形象。</p>
   
    <p> 憶起爸爸的書房牆上，高懸了一副橫軸，宣紙泛黃，還有圈改痕跡，看來是手稿，但鄭重其事的裱褙了，保護在紫檀木玻璃框裡。我們問起來，爸爸就回答，「那是你們曾祖父的字。」 媽媽說，「那是他爺爺唯一的墨寶。」
   </p>
     <p>爸爸1975夏到密西根作訪問學者，我的夫婿允富是密大研究生，爸爸就住在我們家，他常去校園逛圖書館，有一天，他把我帶到東亞圖書館，繞過一排又一排的書架，然後停下來，指著好幾部灰色布紋硬殼的書，書背印著《涵芬樓古今文鈔》, 臨近的架上，還有一套 《漪香山館文集》，絳紫色封面，「這些是我爺爺的作品。」他低聲的說。當時我的反應，類似對家裡的那副字，有如瞻仰博物館的文物，遙遠而陌生。</p>
   
    <p> 看到曾祖父的面貌的一刻，他變真實了。我開始在網路上剝繭抽絲的探詢，居然發掘出好些資料，訂購到再版的《涵芬樓文談》，下載了《漪香山館文集》電子版, 又從加大圖書館借出幾部館內藏書。用心讀了幾篇他的文章，綜合搜集到的資料，讓我對這位從未謀面的老人家開始有些了解，似乎隱約看到爸爸的影子，甚至覺得有些他的性格，竟然顯現在我們身上； 他在清末民初時的著作，逾百年後，還有學者研讀，出版論文，肯定其價值，使我更覺得應該讓後人知道，因此決定提筆，寫下他的生平。我這種想法，與曾祖父百年前寫下紀念他父親的文章，並整理族譜，出發點看來是相似的。</p>
   
   <h2 id="b">從啟蒙到步上講台</h2>
   
     <p>福州古城的屏山南坡左邊，有一區名為華林坊，巷弄縱橫交錯，石板路兩旁高聳的白牆，覆蓋著青黑色的瓦，這種馬鞍形的山牆，是福建古建築的特色，遠看有如波浪。馬鞍牆後面的民居皆比鱗次。今天華林坊已不復存在，留下一個門閘，「華林橫巷」，橫跨兩面山牆間，黑瓦白牆，古意如舊，枝葉繁茂的老榕探出牆頭，鬚根隨風飄懸，牆根下的弄堂，看來陰涼幽靜，彷彿還能聽到布衣書生，背著書箱，漫步踱過的回音。</p>
   
     <p>吳曾祺就在1852年，出生在馬鞍牆後的一棟古屋裡。父親吳少慈，以教私塾養家，入不敷出，賢慧的妻子李氏常領了縫紉刺繡活回家來補充用度。個性沈靜內向的少慈，教書之餘，遍讀文史，研究他有興趣的語音學，讀書練字是他的嗜好也是寄託。</p>
   
     <p>每天日落後，昏黃的燈下，這一家三口圍坐桌前，年幼的曾祺跟父親學著執筆認字，背誦詩詞，母親就靜坐一旁做針線，有時他坐不住了, 母親就弄些點心哄著，一起吃了宵夜，繼續喃喃讀書習字。</p>
   
     <p>這樣靜謐溫暖的日子沒有持久，曾祺六歲時母親病逝，他頓時失去了溫潤的母愛，父親畢生沒有再娶，特別疼愛這唯一的兒子，進出都帶著他在身邊。曾祺耳濡目染，跟著當塾師的父親熟讀經書，學著作詩賦詞，練習書法寫作。他珍惜善本古籍的興趣，與鑑賞佳作的能耐，就是這麼萌芽成長的。</p>
   
     <p>不久他的祖父去世了，十幾歲大的叔父少永就搬來與他們父子同住，叔侄每天一起讀經學詩。叔父自幼就極為聰穎，十歲就寫出一篇《項羽論》，後來又考上了進士，叔父的性情爽朗樂觀，待人慷慨好客，親友上門，有求必應。他也是終身嗜書，甚至家裡沒有米開鍋了，他仍然因為聽到孩子們的書聲朗朗，開懷而笑，這種態度也影響到了曾祺。</p>
   
    <p> 曾祺七八歲起跟陳翥如先生拜師就學，他回憶當時在課堂上，一屋子數十個學生，老師四十歲出頭就滿頭白髮，人很嚴肅，學生都正襟危坐，不敢隨便吭聲。曾祺入學沒有多久，老師見到他寫的文章，異常欣賞，主動找他聊天，跟他談經史說古人，把他當成平起平坐的友人，直到老師過世後，他跟師母和老師的兒子們還維持了多年的交情。少年時期父親與叔父的薰陶，加上塾師的讚賞鼓勵，成為他畢生讀書寫作的動力。</p>
   
     <p>吳曾祺十八歲時進入了新成立的「正誼書院」，相當於今日的公立大學，後來他被舉為書院的傑出校友，「英傑才俊」之一，與末代皇帝的老師陳寶琛，翻譯家林紓等共同列為清朝末年的「名儒」，他們日後對他的發展也有過影響。</p>
   
     <p>二十四歲那年（1876）他與父親少慈公同時考取舉人，父子同榜，傳為佳話。這代表省級考試優秀，有了擔任公職的資格。可惜父親已經年邁體弱，不久就過世了。曾祺外出當過平和、泰寧縣的縣學的教諭，相當於省立學院教授，又當過漳州的中學堂監督，也就是中學校長。1903年，陳寶琛從京師退隱回福州辦學，作了全閩師範學堂的學堂監督，聘他為教務長，相當於今天的福建省立師範大學教務長。</p>
   
     <p>曾祺繼承了父親和叔父的遺傳，極為喜好鑽研經史，吟詩作賦，可是，為了一家生計，和同宗的叔伯兄弟一樣，也踏入教書生涯。不過當時的學生，多半一心只顧應付科舉，教起來索然乏味。他的話，「苦於八口為累，不得已始授徒以自給。」 反映了當時的心態。不過這些年累積的教學心得，啟發了他後來編寫國文教科書時，極力要求文選能「使讀者耳目聰明，精神開朗。」讓學子也能體會到和古人相聚一室，談古論今的樂趣。</p>
   
   <h2 id="c">涵芬樓與涵芬先生</h2>
   
    <p> 1905年，機會來了。 吳曾祺得到好友高嘯桐推薦加入初具規模的「上海商務印書館」，這時他如魚得水，志趣與學問總算得以發揮。</p>
     
     <p>「上海商務印書館」成立於1897年，是清末第一家私人集資開創的出版社，發行過當代最有影響力的書，範圍從社會科學、自然科學、文學藝術、語文和專科工具書，到再版珍本古籍。高嘯同的弟弟高夢旦在出版社初創時應邀負責業務，主理編務印刷，並與張元濟協同主持中國典籍部門，蒐集自古以來的典籍珍本，1904年成立藏書樓，名為「涵芬樓」，取義「善本書香，知識芬芳」。除了善本古籍，還大量搜羅中外各地的書籍雜誌，成為「涵芬樓圖書館」， 對外開放後更名為「東方圖書館」，庫藏據說曾超過五十萬，是中國現代圖書館的前身。</p>
   
     <p>過去古籍珍本不是收錄在朝廷官府的藏書閣，或各省縣的書院，就是在財力雄厚的私人藏書樓。這些典籍，平常百姓是觸摸不到的。「涵芬樓圖書館」以私家出版社作基地，把無價的文化資產匯集於一處，還開放給大眾，這是史無先例的， 也反映了這一班出版社創辦人的理想，認為挽救民族，一定要 「倡明教育，開啟民智」，出版業和圖書館，都是普及教育極為重要的途徑。</p>
   
     <p>吳曾祺到了上海，住進「涵芬樓圖書館」緊鄰的「懌園」，他踏進這藏書樓，無異入了寶山。不分日夜的在館內，整理樓中數十萬卷書集圖冊，協助圖書館的成立。他負責分類編目，考據版本並作批注，摘取精華，收納了有文字以始到清朝，最有代表性的二千多名作者、近萬篇散文，編成了《涵芬樓古今文鈔》，於1910年出版，為這套100 冊巨作寫序的是當代思想家嚴復，推崇此書為「藝苑巨觀」，吳曾祺由此被尊稱為 「涵芬先生」。 「讀萬卷書」 常用以形容一個人學問淵博，曾祺主編文鈔，名符其實的遍覽了萬卷書。</p>
   
     <p>出版這套書，奠下了他學術成就的基礎，在《文鈔》的前言中，他說自幼就喜好讀古文，遇到特別欣賞的篇章，就抄錄下來做了筆記，收藏起來，有空取出來閱覽，就好像越過數千年時空，跟最有學問的人聚在一起，高談闊論，人生沒有比這更愉悅的享受了。這幾句話，點出他的畢生愛好，也讓愛書的人看了感同身受。</p>
   
   <h2 id="d">文史典籍的薪傳</h2>
   
    <p> 吳曾祺一生有過相當豐富的著作，從訓詁批注到擷取菁華，從分析修辭文體，到書寫為文範例，種類繁多。除了最著名的《涵芬樓古今文鈔》，批註經典之作包括 《戰國策補註》，《左傳菁華錄》，還有《歷代名人小簡》等十幾部，這些書籍至今還收藏在中外研究圖書館內。</p>
   
    <p> 值得一提的是，他主編的《中學國文教科書》：這是民國初年全國教育改革開始，最早的中學語文教科書，他熟知古典文史，又有多年教書經驗，可以說是相當理想的人選。從序文裡，看得出他注入了極多心力，盼望學生能領會到文字之美，進一步了解古今佳作的文采架構。 「譬如作畫，雖盈尺之紙，而一邱一壑、一花一葉，亦莫不具精心結構之妙。」 1908年出版後，又再版十一次。這套教科書，匯集了文學史上重要作家的代表作達八百篇，每篇都注了獨特的評語，分析文體的結構、文章的淵源和優劣，撇除傳道說理，而著重如何以佳作為例，提高寫作表達的能力。多年後，研究中國近代語文教學史的學人特意推崇 ，認為內容包含了很多經得起時代淘洗的佳作，肯定了他對中國語文教育的貢獻。</p>
     
    <p> 他最廣為流傳的著作是《涵芬樓文談》。學者喜把此書比喻為「文心雕龍」，談寫作理論，分析古代著名散文佳作的文體與思維，認為好的文章應能適切表達主題，顧到文章的結構韻律，寫作還應培養修辭技巧和審美素養。學界評此書，「援例詳實富裕，理論體系明晰，用語平淺曉暢。」 有人說，連現代學習寫作的人，也能得到啟發。此書出版一世紀後，還不斷的在談論文體和美學修養的論文中被引用，並列入大學中文系必讀教材之一。</p>
   
     <p>晚年出版的《漪香山館文集》，收錄了他畢生代表了各種文體的散文，可以說是將理論付諸實踐的範本，他在序言裡自謙的說，都是「商務印書館」的老同事高夢旦看我年紀大了，還沒什麼文名，就催我把過去的文字收集了出版。又說，如果多少年以後，還有人肯撿出一字一句來挑剔批評，我就算幸運了。他也許沒有預料到，出書的百年以後，還有論文以此書為題，逐篇分析討論，看來他的著述不斷的在新一代的學者心目中得到重生。</p>
   
   <h2 id="e">動亂時代的書生</h2>
     
    <p> 吳曾祺的一生，經歷了中國極為動蕩不安的時代，天災人禍，民不聊生，社會及經濟非常不穩定。他出生時， 正逢太平天國起義（1850 - 1864），四歲那年，英法聯軍發動第二次鴉片戰爭（1856-60），佔領了北京，從他的少年到成年，所聽所聞的，都是清朝一再戰敗，接二連三的與列強簽不平等條約，清朝既有的諾大版圖和屬地，一塊塊失去，數百萬兩的白銀，一箱箱作為賠償金付給戰勝國。</p>
   
    <p> 到了他三十八歲那年，八國聯軍攻陷北京，東海岸與長江沿岸的主要港口都有外國駐軍，設有租界，實質上成了殖民地。1905年他到上海，加入「商務印書館」，協助將「涵芬樓」藏書從租界遷到閘北的本國屬地，五十三歲的他，親身體驗了租界和本國領土的對比。</p>
   
    <p> 吳曾祺六十歲從上海返回福州，周圍的變化更為急遽：1911年辛亥革命，清王朝被推翻，1912年共和成立開始的數十年，初萌芽的民主勢力還非常微弱，再加上主張回復帝制的派系，和各地區掌握武裝勢力的軍閥，不斷爭權奪勢，戰火紛飛，直到1928年全國統一在中華民國旗幟下，他已是七十六歲的老人。</p>
    
     <p>從回到家鄉到去世，近二十年間，他依然埋首寫作， 連續經商務出版發行好幾部作品。那期間也正是新文化運動的開端，與傳統文化新舊交替之際，辯論不斷；福州是南方文化重鎮，也是知識份子集中地: 從辛亥革命到新文化運動，不少革命志士出自福州，「商務印書館」近半數的編輯與作者們是福州人；同鄉嚴復把西方科學政經著作如「天演論」，「原富論」翻譯了介紹給國人，是近代重要的思想家；另一位知名的同鄉林紓，曾翻譯過多種英美文學名作，與他同時編輯國文教材。同時，力主恪守傳統文化的辜鴻銘、陳寶琛等等也來自福州。這些都是他有接觸的人，他也必然聽過各方面的看法，他曾提過，「華林坊」方圓一里內，就有十多位志同道合的友人，不時能相聚，飲酒暢談。</p>
   
     <p>吳曾祺留下的文字間，不論是書信序文、或感言祭文，都流露出他對艱困時局的憂慮，不得伸展壯志的鬱悶，也表達了他對滿腔理想、仗義直言的人由衷敬佩，一再肯定淡泊名利、尊重才學的價值觀。雖然從未特意宣揚個人的觀點，但始終如一的以著作來代表行動，保護傳統文化，改善語文教育。 雖然兩袖清風，還是盡心盡力的與親人相濡以沫，互相周濟。縱使周圍的世界喧鬧混亂，人心惶惶，他彷彿只需在書香中與古人交會，環觀數千年改朝換代的巨浪淘沙，就能坦然面對窗前的疾風暴雨。</p>
   
     <p>1929年吳曾祺逝於福州， 享年77歲。 </p>
   
      <p><i>除卻讀書無所好<br>
       恍如造物與同游</i></p>
   
     <p>應是他對自己最貼切的寫照。</p>

<h2 id="aa">Preface: Finding the Great-Grandfather</h2>

<p>The first time I saw my great-grandfather Wu Zengqi was a photo I found on the Internet two years ago. He has thin cheeks, a white beard, sharp and determined eyes, and a long robe and jacket with a melon skin hat. He is a typical Qing Dynasty literati.</p>

<p>I recalled that on the wall of my father's study room, there was a pair of horizontal scrolls hanging high. The rice paper was yellowed, and there were traces of circles. It seemed to be a manuscript, but it was solemnly mounted and protected in a rosewood glass frame. When we asked, Dad replied, "That's your great-grandfather's calligraphy." Mom said, "That's his grandfather's only calligraphy."</p>

<p>My father went to Michigan as a visiting scholar in the summer of 1975. My husband-in-law, Yun Fu, is a graduate student at Michigan University. My father lives in our house. He often goes to the library on campus. One day, he took me to the East Asian Library, bypassing the Row after row of bookshelves, and then stopped, pointing to several gray cloth hard-covered books, "Han Fen Lou Ancient and Modern Banknotes" printed on the back of the books, and a set of "Yixiangshan Pavilion Anthology" on the adjacent shelf ", purple cover, "These are my grandfather's works." He whispered. My reaction at that time was similar to the words at home, like looking at cultural relics in a museum, distant and unfamiliar.</p>

<p>The moment he saw the face of his great-grandfather, he became real. I started to inquire on the Internet and unearthed a lot of materials. I ordered the reprint of "Han Fen Lou Wen Tan", downloaded the electronic version of "Yi Xiang Shan Guan Anthology", and borrowed a few more from the University of California Library. Books in the library. After carefully reading a few of his articles, and comprehensively collecting information, I began to understand this old man who had never met before. I seemed to vaguely see the shadow of my father, and even felt that some of his personality appeared in us; His works in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, more than a hundred years later, still have scholars studying and publishing papers, affirming its value, which made me feel that it should be known to future generations, so I decided to write down his life. My idea seems to be similar to that of my great-grandfather who wrote an article commemorating his father a hundred years ago and sorted out the family tree.</p>

<h2 id="bb">From Enlightenment to Stepping on the Podium</h2>

<p>On the left side of the southern slope of Pingshan in the ancient city of Fuzhou, there is an area called Hualinfang, with criss-cross lanes and lanes. The towering white walls on both sides of the stone road are covered with blue-black tiles. This kind of saddle-shaped gable is a feature of ancient buildings in Fujian. From a distance, it looks like a wave. The houses behind the saddle wall are all scales. Today, Hualinfang no longer exists, leaving behind a gate, "Hualin Horizontal Alley", which spans between two gable walls, with black tiles and white walls. Hanging, the alley under the wall looks cool and quiet, as if you can still hear the echo of the commoner scholar strolling past with a bookcase on his back.</p>

<p>Wu Zengqi was born in an old house behind the saddle wall in 1852. His father, Wu Shaoci, supported his family by teaching in a private school, so he was unable to make ends meet. His virtuous wife, Li Shi, often took home sewing and embroidery work to make up for the expenses. Shaoci, who is calm and introverted, besides teaching, reads literature and history, studies phonetics which he is interested in, reading and practicing calligraphy is his hobby and sustenance.
</p>
<p>Every day after sunset, under the dim light, the family of three sat around the table. The young Zeng Qi learned to read and recite poems from his father, while his mother would sit quietly and do needlework. Get some snacks to coax, eat supper together, and continue to mutter, read and practice calligraphy.</p>

<p>Such quiet and warm days did not last long. Zeng Qi's mother died of illness when he was six years old, and he immediately lost his warm maternal love. His father never remarried in his life. He loved his only son very much and took him with him every time he went in and out. Zeng Qi was influenced by his ears and eyes, and followed his father who was a school teacher to read scriptures, learn poems and prose, and practice calligraphy. His interest in cherishing rare books and ancient books and his ability to appreciate excellent works sprouted and grew in this way.</p>

<p>Soon after his grandfather passed away, his teenage uncle Shaoyong moved in with them. The uncle and nephew read classics and poetry together every day. My uncle has been extremely intelligent since he was a child. He wrote an article "On Xiang Yu" when he was ten years old, and later he was admitted to Jinshi. His uncle has a bright and optimistic personality, is generous and hospitable to others, and relatives and friends come to his door and respond to every request. He is also a lifelong book addict, even if there is no rice at home, he still laughs because he hears the children's books, and this attitude also affects Zeng Qi.</p>

<p>Zeng Qi began to learn from Mr. Chen Zhuru as a teacher at the age of seven or eight. He recalled that in the classroom, there were dozens of students in a room. The teacher was in his early forties with gray hair and was very serious. Say nothing. Not long after Zeng Qi entered school, the teacher saw his articles and admired them very much. He took the initiative to chat with him, talked with him about classics, history and ancient people, and regarded him as an equal friend. Also maintained a friendship for many years. The influence of his father and uncle in his youth, coupled with the appreciation and encouragement of his tutors, became the driving force for his lifelong reading and writing.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen, Wu Zengqi entered the newly established "Zhengyi College", which is equivalent to today's public university. Lin Shu and others were collectively listed as "famous Confucians" in the late Qing Dynasty, and they also had an influence on his development in the future.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-four years old (1876), he and his father, Shaocigong, were admitted to Juren at the same time. This represents excellence in the provincial examinations and eligibility for public office. Unfortunately, my father was old and frail, and passed away soon. Zeng Qi went out to work as an instructor of the county schools in Pinghe and Taining counties, which is equivalent to a professor of a provincial college, and also served as a middle school supervisor in Zhangzhou, that is, the middle school principal. In 1903, Chen Baochen retired from the capital and returned to Fuzhou to run a school. He became the school supervisor of the Fujian Normal School and hired him as the dean, which is equivalent to the dean of Fujian Provincial Normal University today.</p>

<p>Inherited from his father and uncle, Zeng Qi liked to study classics and history, recite poems and compose fu, but, like his uncles and brothers of the same clan, he also embarked on a teaching career for his family's livelihood. However, most of the students at that time were only focused on coping with the imperial examinations, and the teaching was boring. His words, "It is tiring to suffer from eight mouths, so I have to teach apprentices to support myself." It reflects the mentality at that time. However, the teaching experience accumulated over the years inspired him to write Chinese textbooks later, and strongly demanded that the anthology should "make readers' eyes and ears smart and cheerful." So that students can also experience the joy of gathering with the ancients and talking about the past and the present.</p>

<h2 id="cc">Han Fen Lou and Mr. Han Fen</h2>

<p>In 1905, the opportunity came. Wu Zengqi was recommended by his friend Gao Xiaotong to join the "Shanghai Commercial Press", which had begun to take shape. At this time, he was like a fish in water, and his interests and knowledge were finally brought into play.
</p>
<p>"Shanghai Commercial Press" was established in 1897. It was the first privately-funded publishing house in the late Qing Dynasty. It has published the most influential books in contemporary times, ranging from social sciences, natural sciences, literature and art, Chinese and specialized reference books. to the reprinting of rare and ancient books. Gao Xiaotong’s younger brother, Gao Mengdan, was invited to be in charge of the business when the publishing house was founded, in charge of editing and printing, and co-chaired the Chinese classics department with Zhang Yuanji, collecting rare books from ancient times. In 1904, the library was established, named "Hanfenlou". , which means "the fragrance of rare books, the fragrance of knowledge". In addition to rare books and ancient books, it also collected a large number of books and magazines from all over the world, and became the "Hanfenlou Library". After opening to the outside world, it was renamed "Oriental Library".</p>

<p>In the past, the rare books of ancient books were either collected in the Zangshu Pavilion of the imperial court, or in the academies of various provinces and counties, or in private libraries with strong financial resources. These classics are beyond the reach of ordinary people. Based on a private publishing house, "Han Fen Lou Library" gathers priceless cultural assets in one place and opens them up to the public. This is unprecedented, and it also reflects the ideals of the founders of this group of publishing houses. He believes that to save the nation, we must "advocate education and open up the wisdom of the people." The publishing industry and libraries are extremely important ways to popularize education.</p>

<p>When Wu Zengqi arrived in Shanghai, he lived in the "Yiyuan" next to the "Hanfenlou Library". When he stepped into this library, it was like entering Baoshan. In the library day and night, sort out hundreds of thousands of books and albums in the building, and assist in the establishment of the library. He was in charge of classification and cataloguing, textual research and annotation of editions, extraction of the essence, and collection of more than 2,000 most representative authors and nearly 10,000 essays from the beginning of the Qing Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, compiling "Han Fen Lou Ancient and Modern Papers" , was published in 1910. It was the contemporary thinker Yan Fu who wrote the preface to this 100-volume masterpiece. "Reading ten thousand volumes of books" is often used to describe a person who is knowledgeable. Zeng Qi edited the banknotes, and he has read ten thousand volumes of books.
</p>
<p>The publication of this set of books laid the foundation for his academic achievements. In the preface of "Wenchao", he said that he liked to read ancient Chinese since he was a child. Take it out and read it, it's like traveling through thousands of years of time and space, gathering with the most knowledgeable people and talking about it, there is no more enjoyable enjoyment in life than this. These few words point out his lifelong hobbies, and also make people who love books empathize with them.
</p>
<h2 id="dd">The Inheritance of Literary and Historical Classics</h2>

<p>Wu Zengqi has produced quite a lot of works in his life, ranging from exegetical annotations to extracting the essence, from analyzing rhetorical styles to writing examples. In addition to the most famous "Han Fen Lou Ancient and Modern Banknotes", the annotated classics include "Supplementary Notes to the Warring States Policy", "Zuo Zhuan Essence Records", and "Little Notes of Celebrities in Past Dynasties" and more than a dozen other books. These books are still collected today. Inside the Chinese and Foreign Studies Library.
</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that he edited "Chinese Textbook for Middle Schools": this is the earliest Chinese textbook for middle schools since the national education reform began in the early years of the Republic of China. He is familiar with classical literature and history and has many years of teaching experience. It can be said that he is quite an ideal candidate. From the preface, it can be seen that he has put a lot of effort into it, hoping that students can appreciate the beauty of words and further understand the literary structure of ancient and modern masterpieces. "It's like painting, although there is a lot of paper, but every Qiu, every valley, every flower and every leaf has a delicate structure." After it was published in 1908, it was reprinted eleven times. This set of textbooks brings together 800 representative works of important writers in the history of literature, each of which is annotated with unique comments, analyzing the structure of the style, the origin and pros and cons of the article, ignoring preaching and reasoning, and emphasizing how to use good examples as examples. Improve the ability of writing expression. Many years later, scholars who study the history of Chinese language teaching in modern China specially praised it, believing that the content contained many excellent works that could stand the washing of the times, and affirmed his contribution to Chinese language education.
</p>
<p>His most widely circulated book is "Han Fen Lou Wen Tan". Scholars like to compare this book to "Wen Xin Diao Long", talk about writing theory, analyze the style and thinking of famous ancient prose works, and believe that a good article should be able to express the theme appropriately, taking into account the structure and rhythm of the article, and writing should also cultivate rhetoric skills and aesthetics. The academic circle commented on this book, "The examples are detailed and rich, the theoretical system is clear, and the language is simple and clear." Some people say that even modern people who study writing can be inspired. A century after its publication, this book has been continuously cited in papers on stylistic and aesthetic accomplishment, and has been listed as one of the required textbooks for Chinese departments in universities.
</p>
<p>The Collected Works of Yixiangshanguan, published in his later years, included his lifelong essays representing various styles of prose, which can be said to be a model for putting theory into practice. Colleague Gao Mengdan saw that I was getting old and didn't have any literary titles yet, so he urged me to collect and publish my past writings. He also said that if after many years, there are still people who are willing to pick out every single word to criticize, I will be considered lucky. He may not have expected that a hundred years after the publication of the book, there would still be papers on this book, analyzing and discussing it one by one. It seems that his writings are constantly being reborn in the minds of new generations of scholars.
</p>
<h2 id="ee">Scholar in Troubled Times</h2>

<p>In Wu Zengqi's life, he experienced an extremely turbulent era in China, with natural and man-made disasters, people living in dire straits, and social and economic instability. When he was born, it coincided with the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864). At the age of four, the British and French allied forces launched the Second Opium War (1856-60) and occupied Beijing. From his youth to adulthood, he heard, It was because the Qing Dynasty was repeatedly defeated and signed unequal treaties with the great powers one after another. The Qing Dynasty’s existing large territory and territories were lost piece by piece, and millions of taels of silver were paid to the victorious countries as compensation.
</p>
<p>When he was thirty-eight years old, the Eight-Power Allied Forces captured Beijing, and the main ports on the east coast and along the Yangtze River had foreign troops stationed there and set up concessions, effectively becoming colonies. In 1905, he went to Shanghai and joined the "Commercial Press" to help move the collection of "Han Fen Lou" from the concession to his own territory in Zhabei. At the age of 53, he personally experienced the contrast between the concession and his own territory.
</p>
<p>Wu Zengqi returned to Fuzhou from Shanghai at the age of 60. The surrounding changes were even more rapid: the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, and in the decades since the founding of the Republic in 1912, the budding democratic forces were still very weak. The factions of the imperial system and the warlords who controlled the armed forces in various regions continued to fight for power, and the flames of war raged until the whole country was unified under the banner of the Republic of China in 1928. He was already 76 years old.
</p> 
<p>From returning to his hometown to his death, in the past twenty years, he was still immersed in writing, and several works were published through commercial publishing in succession. During that period, it was also the beginning of the New Culture Movement. There were constant debates between the new and the old traditional culture. Fuzhou was an important cultural town in the south, and it was also the center of intellectuals: from the 1911 Revolution to the New Culture Movement, many revolutionaries came from Fuzhou. Nearly half of the editors and authors of the "Commercial Press" are from Fuzhou; Yan Fu, a fellow countryman, translated and introduced Western scientific and political works such as "Tianyanlun" and "Yuanfulun" to Chinese people. He is an important thinker in modern times; Lin Shu, a well-known fellow from his hometown, had translated many English and American literary masterpieces, and edited Chinese textbooks with him at the same time. At the same time, Gu Hongming and Chen Baochen, who insisted on adhering to traditional culture, also came from Fuzhou. These are people he has contact with, and he must have heard opinions from all sides. He once mentioned that within a mile radius of "Hua Linfang", there are more than ten like-minded friends who meet from time to time, drink and talk freely .
</p>
<p>The words left by Wu Zengqi, whether it is the preface to the letter or the sacrificial speech, reveal his worries about the difficult situation and his depression of not being able to expand his ambitions. They also express his sincere admiration for people who are full of ideals and speak out. Affirm the value of being indifferent to fame and wealth and respecting talent and learning. Although I have never deliberately promoted my personal views, I have always used my writings to represent actions, protect traditional culture, and improve Chinese education. Although the two sleeves are cool, they still do their best to help each other with their relatives and help each other. Even though the world around him is noisy and chaotic, and people are panic-stricken, he seems to be able to calmly face the storm in front of the window as long as he meets the ancients in the fragrance of books and looks around the huge waves washing away the thousands of years of dynasties.
</p>
<p>Wu Zengqi died in Fuzhou in 1929 at the age of 77.
</p>
<p><i>Nothing but reading<br>
Like Creation and Traveling Together</i>
</p>
<p>It should be his most appropriate portrayal of himself.</p>
